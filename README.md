# Sandwich Project Collection Sites

## Important: Dual File Structure

This project has **two `app.js` files** that must be kept in sync:

- `/app.js` - Source file
- `/public/app.js` - Served to the browser

**When making changes to the React application, you MUST update BOTH files.**

The `public/app.js` is what actually gets served to users. If you only edit the root `app.js`, your changes will not appear in the browser.
